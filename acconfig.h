   Descriptive text for the C preprocessor macros that
   the distributed Autoconf macros can define.

   The entries are in sort -df order: alphabetical, case insensitive,
   ignoring punctuation (such as underscores).  Although this order
   can split up related entries, it makes it easier to check whether
   a given entry is in the file.
